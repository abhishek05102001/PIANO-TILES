# PIANO-TILES
This is a project based on Piano using Arduino and other components. It is simulated in Proteus Software. Once we start the simulation the LCD display starts and on clicking each of the Seven keys we get a different Music based on frequecy set in code which is provided. The folder has  .hex file which hex file of code. 
Once we change the direction of SPDT switch it will play the recorded tune.
This is how the project Works.
Music.pdsprj is proteus file which contains actual simulation. once it opens just start simulation. Music.ino is arduino IDE code file. Music.ino.hex is hex file.
download the complete folder and keep all files in it.
PCB is the extension of LCD display which has no use just we need to keep it as i have made this particular LCD display on my own.
Thanks and Regards
