# PIANO-TILES
This is a project based on Piano using Arduino and other components. It is simulated in Proteus Software. Once we start the simulation the LCD display starts and on clicking each of the Seven keys we get a different Music based on frequecy set in code which is provided. The folder has  .hex file which hex file of code. 
Once we change the direction of SPDT switch it will play the recorded tune.
This is how the project Works.
